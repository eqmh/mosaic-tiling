# mosaic-tiling

This repository contains resources for subsetting and formatting photo-mosaic imagery for classification and percent cover analysis in CoralNet.

Subsetted tiles of 1x1m from ensambled photo-mosaics can then be uploaded to the [FK_photo-mosaic](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/source/4235/) Resource on CoralNet for processing.
