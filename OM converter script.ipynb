    "# Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, you will pre-process benthic imagery for automatic classification and percent cover calculation of observed benthic categories using [CoralNet](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/). CoralNet is an online, open-source machine learning classifier that enables the identification of benthic species and their relative abundance using an unsupervised species annotation algorithm and a predefined set of labels of species and bottom types as training data. In addition to the main trained classifier that automatically processes new images, there are a number of trained classifiers users can select for their images. These classifiers can be used to detect the presence of individual species in a reef habitat, and estimate percent cover of functional groups and benthic characteristics like bottom type in a automated fashion with minimum human effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "Benthic images may need to be pre-processed before ingestion into CoralNet. CoralNet restricts images to a maximum of 8000 x 8000 pixels, which prevents uploading large photomosaics. Orthomosaics are photomosaics generated when virtually reconstructing reefs in 3D with photogrammetric techniques, and can be used in conjunction with digital elevation models. Splitting a large orthomosaic or photomosaic into smaller images is necessary to use CoralNet, but a manual tiling process can be time consuming. This notebook has multiple methods to tile orthomosaics based on 1) [shapefile generated in GIS software](#1-the-om-is-split-according-to-a-grid-formatted-in-a-shapefile-created-in-arcgis-pro) and 2) [identically sized cells defined by number of pixels](#2-the-om-is-split-into-identifically-sized-cells-defined-by-number-of-pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benthic images may also include a physical photoquadrat to standardize data collection. This notebook also contains [Quadrant Recon](https://pypi.org/project/quadrantrecon/), an image recognition tool designed to crop quadrants from benthic imagery collected with photoquadrats as a preprocessing step for CoralNet. As configured by default, this tool will recognize yellow edges of quadrants collected following a standardized [protocol](https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/handle/11329/2199.2) developed by the [MBON Pole to Pole Project](https://marinebon.github.io/p2p/index.html) on any file you select, and crop their inside area. The detection parameters can be configured to detect other colors, crop differently sized images, or even ignore different parts of the image to detect other quadrant-like shapes.\n",
